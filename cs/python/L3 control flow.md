```python
three control structures
1. sequence structure 顺序结构
3. selective 选择结构 condition
3. cycle  循环结构 loop
```

```python
if 
    注意缩进 同一个缩进代表同一级
    if (condition):
        block1
    else:
        block2
```

```python
2.1 while
    2.1.1 定义
    while condition：
        block
        change used to stop loop
    
    2.1.2 中断
    break + continue
        if condition:
            break 全局中断
        if condition:
            continue 跳出本次循环 

2.2 for 
    2.2.1 range function
        for i in range (number):
            print(list[i])
    2.2.2 do it with for
        for x in list:
            print(x)
```



```python
three useful templates
for i in range (N):
    do something using "i" as index 


i = 0
while i < N:
    do something using i as index:
    change the cycle variable


do something with every element in the sequence data
    for representator in sequence_data:
        do something with the represenetation
```

```python
trick
